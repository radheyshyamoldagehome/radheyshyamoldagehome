                                <p> Homoeopathy – A Natural Therapy : It is holistic as it considers the individual’s physical, mental and emotional symptoms and treats the sum of the symptoms according to the “RULE OF SIMILE’.
Homoeopathy is described as a specifically determined or organ-specific threshold stimulation therapy.  The aim of this therapy is to produce a ‘REACTIVATION’ or stimulation of the autoregulator activity in the organism.  Homoeopathy is natural therapy, directed at an active participation of the organism’s natural capacity to react and regulate, adapt and regenerate itself, as well as defend itself against pathogenic influences/noxius effects.

                                <p> The symptoms, in their totality are the pre requirement for the selection of the medicament according to the ‘RULE OF SIMILE’.
In the past Homoeopathy was the second largest system of medicine being practiced in India, however in the present era, the homoeo treatment is now the first choice, as it is developed as full-pledged alternative system of medicine.  It is now more popular, due to the recent developments and research, for treating patients.   Homoeopathy cures perhaps more than allopathy does because it does not disturb the patientnams and allows the nature to deal with them.   Unlike other system of medical treatments, homoeopathy system cures permanently.

Our moto is to name our visitors as our customers  not patients, as we never wish to see them as Patients.  Because we trusts the believers of homoepathy, will consume homeo medicines never fall sick and become patients.   We help them to be vigilant and be preventive by taking homoeo remedies at right time or early stage of symptems,  thus leading them not to become victims of dieseases and further avoid for going to surgeries.   Therefore homodo doctors claim that they are surgeons without knife.
Homoeo medicines whatever we give, are extensively safe to use, and there will be no side effects, even with small children.  Our  qualified and well experienced doctors take complete case study in depth details and detailed history of the patients.    A thorough examination will be carried out, on physical status, mental and emotional status and decide the constitutional medicines according to the observations/features.  Our doctors also take the help of modern software of homoeopathic technics for prompting to decide exact remidies.  So far our doctors dealt with many chronic cases which could not cure by allowpathy or ayurvedha, and successfully treated almost all the cases.   We illustrate such success stories in the annexed chapters.
